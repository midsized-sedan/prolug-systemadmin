üìã General Tips for Your Project
Documentation: Keep detailed records of your setup process, configurations, and any issues encountered. This will be invaluable for your final report and presentation.

Diagrams: Use tools like Draw.io or Excalidraw to create clear diagrams of your system architecture.

Presentation: Prepare a slide deck (15-20 slides) covering your project's purpose, architecture, implementation, challenges faced, and lessons learned. Tools like Overleaf can help create professional-looking presentations.
