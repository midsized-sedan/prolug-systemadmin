Questions:
1) What do you hope to learn in thise course?
  - I think the primary thing I want to learn is direction. I'm at a point in my knowledge and career
  where I don't know how to proceed, but I think that I would really enjoy something
  linux centric. I've enjoyed installing, configuring, and using linux in my own time, but
  I know that I don't have the knowledge needed for an actual linux position.
2) What type of career path are you shooting for?
  - I think I want to focus on System Administration, at least to get started.
  From there maybe I'll look into linux networking or security, but my primary goal
  is to get into an actual linux job, rather than the dev work I was doing.


### 2

1) Post a job that you are interested in from a local job website (link or image)
  - [Systems Administrator for IBM](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=4168505275&geoId=106233382&keywords=Linux&origin=JOBS_HOME_SEARCH_BUTTON&refresh=true)

2) What do you know how to do in the posting?
  - I've worked with Python, Web UI, HTML5, CSS, JS, SQL, HTTP before.

3) What don't you know how to do in the posting?
  - Bash scripting (been too long), and I dont' have extensive linux expereince.
  I don't know what hypervisor is and how to properly setup and maintain IT systems

4) What are you doing to close the gap? What can you do to remedy the difference?
  - First thing is to do this course and the security engineering course. I also
  plan on working on Bash scripting more.


## Definitions

Kernel: The middleman between software and the hardware. It's a program that
has control over everything in the system. It's responsible for the management
of hardware resources, making them available for sotware to use as well as mitigating
or handling conflicts between software.

Kernel Args: These are arguments (aka parameters) that are passed to the kernel at boot time.
These args can define specific settings and enable/disable features of the kernel.
They can also help with troubleshooting.

OS Version: The version of the OS that you are using. That includes the name and 
major/minor version numbers.

Modules: Kernel modules are code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel
on demand like drivers, support for file systems, and security features.

Mount Points: Its a directory where an external filesystem is attached to
your existing filesystem, such as when you plug in a USB drive.
In Windows, drives have letters to name them. In Linux, everything is mounted
under the root (/) folder so once an external drive is connected its just another
folder.

Text Editor: A program that can open and edit files. I use Neovim btw.


## Digging Deeper

Use vimtutor and see how far you get. What did you learn that you did not know about vi/vim?

Go to https://vim-adventures.com/ and see how far you get. 
What did you learn that you did not already know about vi/vim?

## Reflection Questions

1. What questions do you still have about this week?

Its hard to come up with questions right now because there's so much I don't know
and even more I don't know that I don't know. Really then, I just want to learn what
is needed for a system admin position.

2. How are you going to use what you've learned in your current role?

I already use most of what this unit taught in my day to day as I use Linux
on one of my machines. I use Arch btw.
