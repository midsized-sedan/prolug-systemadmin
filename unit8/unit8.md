# Unit 8 - Scripting

## Overview


This unit focuses on scripting and system checks in Linux environments, 
with particular emphasis on bash scripting for system administration tasks. It covers:

	- *Bash Scripting Fundamentals:* Mastery of shell scripting is essential for 
	automating routine administrative tasks, implementing monitoring solutions, 
	and creating custom tools that enhance system management capabilities.

	- *System Monitoring and Checks:* Linux administrators must continuously monitor
	system health, resource utilization, and potential security issues. This unit
	explores techniques for creating scripts that perform automated system checks,
	gather performance metrics, and alert administrators to potential problems.

	- *Logical Flow and Decision Making:* The ability to implement complex 
	decision-making logic in scripts is crucial for handling various system conditions
	and scenarios. Students will learn to use conditional statements, comparison 
	operators, and truth tables to create intelligent scripts that can adapt to 
	different situations.

	- *Automation and Scheduled Tasks:* Effective system administration requires
	automating repetitive tasks and scheduling routine maintenance. This unit covers
	techniques for creating scripts that can be executed automatically through cron
	jobs or systemd timers, reducing manual intervention.

## Learning Objectives

1. Create and Execute Bash Scripts:

	- Develop proficiency in writing and executing bash scripts for system administration
	tasks.
	- Learn to use variables, conditional statements, and loops effectively in scripts.

2. Apply Logical Structures and Decision Making:

	- Master the use of if/then/else statements, case statements, and logical operators.
	- Understand truth tables and how they apply to script logic.
	- Learn to implement complex decision trees that handle multiple conditions.

3. Develop Error Handling and Logging:

	- Implement robust error detection and handling in scripts.
	- Create comprehensive logging systems that facilitate troubleshooting.
	- Design scripts that can recover from common error conditions.

4. Analyze and Improve Script Maintainability:

	- Recognize patterns of poor script design and implement improvements.
	- Organize code with functions and meaningful variable names.
	- Document scripts effectively for future maintenance.

## Relevance & Context

The skills taught in this unit are essential for several critical reasons:

	- *Efficiency and Automation:* In enterprise environments, manual administration
	of systems is time-consuming and error-prone. Scripting allows administrators to
	automate routine tasks, significantly reducing the time required and minimizing
	human error. This automation is particularly valuable for tasks that must be
	performed consistently across multiple systems.

	- *Scalability and Consistency:* As infrastructure grows, manual administration
	becomes increasingly impractical. Scripts enable administrators to implement
	consistent configurations and perform identical operations across dozens, hundreds,
	or even thousands of systems simultaneously. This scalability is essential in
	modern data centers and cloud environments.

	- *Knowledge Transfer and Documentation:* Scripts serve as executable documentation
	of system procedures and configurations. When an administrator creates a script
	to perform a specific task, they are effectively documenting that process in
	a format that can be shared, reviewed, and executed by others. This facilitates
	knowledge transfer within teams and ensures operational continuity.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the scripting and system checks covered in this unit, 
learners should possess the following foundational knowledge and skills:

	- *Command-Line Proficiency:* A solid understanding of the Linux command line
	interface is essential. Students should be comfortable navigating the file system,
	executing commands, and interpreting command output. This includes familiarity
	with common utilities such as grep, awk, sed, and find.

	- *Basic Text Editing Skills:* Since scripts are text files, the ability to 
	create and modify text files using editors like vi, vim, nano, or emacs is 
	necessary. Students should be able to open files, make changes, save modifications,
	and exit editors efficiently.

	- *Fundamental Linux System Architecture:* An understanding of the Linux file
	hierarchy, process management, and service control is required. Students should
	know where configuration files are typically located, how to check system status,
	and how to start and stop services.

	- *Basic Programming Concepts:* While this unit will teach scripting from the
	ground up, familiarity with basic programming concepts such as variables,
	conditions, loops, and functions will accelerate learning. Students who have
	experience with any programming language will find these concepts transferable
	to bash scripting.

## Lecture Notes

### Topics of Discussions

Flow of a program
Variables
Decisions - Flow from Logic
Truth tables
Interpreted vs. compiled Programs

### Flow of a program

In scripting programs flow from top to bottom, executing sequentially until
there is no work to be done.

You can affect this flow with decisions, loops, and functions.
	- Decisions alter course or select different paths.
	- Loops count over items or test conditions.
	- Functions are blocks that only execute when called.

### Truth Tables

Binary Logic
- ^ is AND
- v is OR
